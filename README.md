I have spend a lot of time on this project, probably more than I would have initially liked to. However I am very happy with the outcome.

Important to note, that the program does not correlate well the UML diagram listed as an example solution. It was mentioned in class that the implementation did not have to utilize generic types. Were it the case, then I would not have chosen to implement the solution in Go. [Go and generics](https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step). Since the language has no support for generic type âˆ´ it would not really be possible.
