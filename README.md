Important to note, that the program does not correlate well the UML diagram listed as an example solution. It was mentioned in class that the implementation did not have to utilize generic types. Were it the case that the solution had to, then I would not have chosen to implement the solution in Go. [Go and generics](https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step). Since the language has no support for generic type âˆ´ it would not really be possible. Go does not utilize interfaces the same way other OO languages like Java or Kotlin does, so I have chosen not to use an interface for the set implementaiton.
